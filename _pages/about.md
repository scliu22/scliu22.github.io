Hi, I'm Sidney! I'm currently doing my MS in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Notre Dame. I previously did my undergrad at Colby College in Mathematical Sciences and Computer Science.

My research interests can be summarized as follows:

- **Graph Learning**: focusing on developing algorithms and models to understand, represent, and analyze relational data structures for applications across diverse fields such as social networks, chemistry, and recommendation systems.
- **Large Foundation Models**: focusing on developing and leveraging massive, pretrained AI systems with broad and multimodal capabilities.

As of today, I'm actively investigating ways to improve the mathematical reasoning capablities of Large Foundation Models, specifically with regards to problems at the more advanced, graduate levels.
